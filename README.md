Much of the materials presented here were adapted from lectures used in the first half of a graduate-level course "Statistical Methods in Ecology and Evolution II" taught at Michigan State University. A substantial portion of those materials were developed by [Elise Zipkin](https://zipkinlab.org/), as well as adapted from portions of multiple of [Marc K&eacute;ry's](https://www.mbr-pwrc.usgs.gov/pubanalysis/keryroylebook/) textbooks.
